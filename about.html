                    Hi, my name is Arda.<br><br>
                    I started creating crime folders after a night of crime solving with friends. The thrill of unraveling mysteries sparked an interest in me to create engaging and challenging puzzles that would make others think deeply.
                </p><br><br>
                <p>
                    My goal is to create something that not only entertains but also makes users engage with the material in a way that requires problem-solving skills. I want my puzzles to challenge your intellect and creativity.
                </p><br><br>
                <p>
                    I'm always happy to receive feedback, whether it's about my puzzles or suggestions for new ones. Please feel free to reach out to me!
                </p>
